         <p>
            I am a postdoctoral scholar in theoretical and computational chemistry.  This means that, theoretically, I can both use computers and do chemistry.  I received my PhD working with Profs. Aaron Dinner and Jonathan Weare working on enhanced sampling algorithms.

         <p>
            Currently, I am appointed at the University of Chicago and a long-term visiting scholar at the Flatiron Institute.  
            I am working with Prof. Risi Kondor on developing new machine learning architectures for molecular systems.

         <h2>About This Website</h2>
         <p>
             You might be wondering why this website looks like it was slapped together using rudimentary HTML.  This is because it was slapped together using only rudimentary HTML.  
             In fact, most of it is only half-remembered from a Computer Science A/B course taken a decade ago at the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics.

             I recognize that it is the 2019 and that people have made templates for pretty websites that use fancy web development tools named after coffee or jazz musicians.  
             However, I like doing things myself, so I'm building it on my own. 
             I expect the website to improve rapidly once I finish the <a href=https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp>w3schools html tutorial</a> and learn things like "CSS".
