            I am a postdoctoral scholar in theoretical and computational chemistry.  This means that, theoretically, I can both use computers and do chemistry.  I received my PhD working with Profs. Aaron Dinner and Jonathan Weare working on enhanced sampling algorithms.
            <br />
            <br />
            Currently, I am appointed at the University of Chicago and a long-term visiting scholar at the Flatiron Institute.  
            I am working with Prof. Risi Kondor on developing new machine learning architectures for molecular systems.
