            <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am a postdoctoral scholar studying theoretical and computational chemistry.  This means that, theoretically, I can both use computers and do chemistry.  I received my PhD working with Profs. Aaron Dinner and Jonathan Weare working on enhanced sampling algorithms.
            <br>
            <br>
            Currently, I am a Research Fellow at the Flatiron Institute, in the CCM.
            <br>
            <h2>Current Projects</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>New approaches for learning on Permutation-equivariant structures </h3>
                    Chemical systems are complex arrangements of identical parts.  
                    As a consequence, symmetry under permutation is fundamental to chemical systems.
                    However, this symmetry also severely restricts the space of possible learning algorithms:
                    if not constructed carefully, algorithms that attempt to learn new structures must face a combinatorial explosion
                    in the number of terms.
                    Currently, I am working with Prof. Risi Kondor to develop new approaches to learning on chemical systems.
                    By intelligently exploiting and learning substructures of a chemical system, 
                    we hope to generate richer representations of chemical systems.

                    <h3>Neural Architectures for CryoEM</h3>
                    CryoEM allows one to capture millions of images of a biomolecule, each of which is a two-dimensional projection of the molecular structure.  
                    These images must then be combined to form a three-dimensional molecular structure; a task complicated by the high noise levels in the image.
                    A key step in the recombination is learning the relative angles between the projection axis in each image.
                    <a href="https://hannahlawrence.github.io/">Hannah Lawrence</a> and I are developing neural techniques for learning these relative rotations.
                    In addition, I am working with Dr. Pilar Cossio on new algorithms for extracting free energy surfaces from CryoEM data.

                    <h3>Error Estimates for MBAR</h3>
                    The Multistate Bennett Acceptance Ratio is a popular framework for estimating free energies from multiple biased simulations.
                    In the <a href="https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.4960649">EMUS paper</a>, we introduced the iterative eigenvector method for umbrella sampling (iEMUS) algorithm that allows for extremely rapid (1-2 iterations) convergence of the MBAR equations.
                    Since then, we have found that iEMUS also allows for accurate error estimates for MBAR that account for autocorrelation times and give state-wise contributions to the error.  
                    I am mentoring Sherry Li in exploring and extending these expressions.
