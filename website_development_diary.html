    <h1>Website Development Diary</h1>
    <p>
    If you are of the literary persuasion, this is a diary describing the development of this website.
    If you are more of a coder, this is a very poorly organized Changelog.

        This website now uses <del>crop and soil science</del> <del>child safety seats</del> <del>convolutional spectral shaping</del> cascading style sheets!

             Today I began developing my personal website.  You, dear reader, might be wondering why this website looks like it was slapped together using only rudimentary HTML.  This is because it was slapped together using only rudimentary HTML.  
             In fact, most of it is only half-remembered from a Computer Science A/B course taken a decade ago at the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics.

             I recognize that it is the 2019 and that people have made templates for pretty websites that use fancy web development tools named after coffee or jazz musicians.  
             However, I like doing things myself, so I'm building it on my own. 
             I expect the website to improve rapidly once I finish the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">w3schools html tutorial</a> and learn things like "CSS".
